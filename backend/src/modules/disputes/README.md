# Dispute Resolution Module Implementation

## Overview

A robust Dispute Resolution module has been implemented to handle rental-related disputes between landlords and tenants, including dispute creation, evidence submission, status tracking, and resolution management.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Create and manage disputes
- ✅ Upload and manage evidence
- ✅ Track dispute status
- ✅ Internal notes and comments
- ✅ Resolution and settlement
- ✅ Automated status updates
- ✅ Notification system

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/disputes` - Create new dispute
- `GET /api/disputes` - List disputes (with filters)
- `GET /api/disputes/:id` - Get dispute details
- `PUT /api/disputes/:id` - Update dispute
- `POST /api/disputes/:id/evidence` - Add evidence
- `POST /api/disputes/:id/resolve` - Resolve dispute
- `POST /api/disputes/:id/comment` - Add comment
- `GET /api/agreements/:id/disputes` - List disputes for agreement

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **disputes** - Main dispute records
2. **dispute_evidence** - Evidence files and documents
3. **dispute_comments** - Comments and internal notes

### Key Fields

- Dispute types: RENT_PAYMENT, SECURITY_DEPOSIT, PROPERTY_DAMAGE, MAINTENANCE, TERMINATION, OTHER
- Status workflow: OPEN → UNDER_REVIEW → RESOLVED/REJECTED/WITHDRAWN
- UUID-based dispute identification
- Metadata support for additional information

## Architecture Components

### Entities

- `Dispute` - Main dispute entity with relationships
- `DisputeEvidence` - File attachments and evidence
- `DisputeComment` - Comments (public and internal)

### DTOs

- `CreateDisputeDto` - Dispute creation validation
- `UpdateDisputeDto` - Dispute updates
- `AddEvidenceDto` - Evidence file uploads
- `AddCommentDto` - Comment creation
- `ResolveDisputeDto` - Dispute resolution
- `QueryDisputesDto` - Filtering and pagination

### Services

- `DisputesService` - Core business logic
- `DisputeNotificationService` - Event notifications
- `FileUploadService` - Evidence file management

### Controllers

- `DisputesController` - REST API endpoints with full CRUD operations

### Security & Validation

- Role-based access control (Admin, Landlord, Tenant)
- Permission guards for dispute operations
- File upload validation (type, size limits)
- Status transition validation
- Input sanitization and validation pipes

### Testing

- Unit tests for service layer
- Controller tests for API endpoints
- Mock implementations for dependencies

## Business Logic

### Dispute Creation

- Validates agreement exists and is active
- Verifies user permission (landlord/tenant only)
- Prevents duplicate active disputes
- Updates agreement status to 'disputed'

### Evidence Management

- Secure file upload with validation
- Support for images, PDFs, and documents
- File size limits (10MB max)
- Automatic file naming and storage

### Resolution Process

- Admin-only resolution capability
- Status workflow enforcement
- Agreement status restoration on resolution
- Audit logging for all actions

### Notifications

- Automatic notifications for dispute events
- Multi-party notification system
- Internal comment notifications to admins
- Status change alerts

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

- JWT authentication required
- Role-based permissions
- Dispute party verification
- Admin-only resolution access

### File Security

- MIME type validation
- File size restrictions
- Secure file storage
- Access control for evidence files

### Data Protection

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention via TypeORM
- Audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting support

## Integration Points

### Existing Modules

- **RentAgreements** - Dispute-agreement relationship
- **Users** - User roles and permissions
- **Audit** - Activity logging
- **Auth** - Authentication and authorization

### External Services

- File storage (local/S3 ready)
- Email notifications (pluggable)
- Payment processing (for refunds)

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Dispute

```typescript
POST /api/disputes
{
  "agreementId": "uuid-123",
  "disputeType": "SECURITY_DEPOSIT",
  "requestedAmount": 1500.00,
  "description": "Unfair deduction from security deposit"
}
```

### Adding Evidence

```typescript
POST /api/disputes/dispute-uuid/evidence
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
file: [binary file data]
description: "Photo of property condition"
```

### Resolving a Dispute

```typescript
POST /api/disputes/dispute-uuid/resolve
{
  "resolution": "Partial refund approved for cleaning costs",
  "refundAmount": 300.00
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Automated dispute resolution suggestions
- Integration with payment systems
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Document signing integration
- Multi-language support

### Scalability

- Redis caching for frequent queries
- Queue system for notifications
- Microservice decomposition
- Database optimization

## Deployment Notes

### Database Migration

Run the migration to create the required tables:

```bash
npm run migration:run
```

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are configured:

- File upload directory permissions
- Database connection
- JWT secret
- File size limits

### Monitoring

- Dispute creation metrics
- Resolution time tracking
- File storage usage
- API performance monitoring

## Conclusion

The Dispute Resolution Module provides a comprehensive foundation for handling rental disputes with proper security, validation, and user experience. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and integration with existing systems while maintaining data integrity and compliance requirements.
