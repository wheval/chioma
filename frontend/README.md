This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Map Feature

The interactive map feature uses **Leaflet with OpenStreetMap** - **no API key required!**

- ✅ 100% free
- ✅ No setup needed
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No usage limits

See [LEAFLET_SETUP.md](./LEAFLET_SETUP.md) for more details.

### Property Listing Wizard

The landlord listing flow is available at `/landlords/properties/add` with:

- 8 guided steps (basic info through preview/publish)
- progress indicator and listing completeness score
- auto-save + manual save draft support
- resume-later behavior through server-backed draft records
- preview-and-publish action for completed listings

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Error Handling Architecture

The frontend now includes a centralized, typed error handling system with route and component boundaries.

### What is in place

- `lib/errors/*`: shared error types, classifiers, message catalog, logging, and retry helpers.
- `components/error/ErrorFallback.tsx`: accessible reusable fallback UI with retry + safe navigation.
- `components/error/ClientErrorBoundary.tsx`: component-level React boundary for critical UI regions.
- `app/error.tsx`, `app/landlords/error.tsx`, `app/dashboard/error.tsx`, `app/tenant/error.tsx`: route-level recoverable boundaries.
- `components/error/ErrorMonitoringProvider.tsx`: captures `window.onerror` and unhandled promise rejections.
- `components/error/NetworkStatusBanner.tsx`: offline detection with visible recovery action.

### Usage conventions

- Prefer `classifyUnknownError(...)` in `catch` blocks to normalize unknown failures.
- Use `appError.userMessage` for user-facing feedback.
- Use `logError(...)` to report structured context and preserve debugging metadata.
- Wrap risky/critical component sections with `ClientErrorBoundary` for local recovery.
- Keep form-level failures accessible via `role="alert"` and `aria-live` (see `FormErrorAlert`).

### Optional external reporting

To connect a real monitoring provider (Sentry, Datadog, etc.), set a browser reporter function:

```ts
window.__CHIOMA_ERROR_REPORTER__ = (payload) => {
  // Forward payload to your monitoring endpoint
};
```

## Pipeline Validation with Makefile

### Frontend Pipeline Checks

The frontend includes a Makefile to run all CI/CD pipeline checks locally before creating a PR. This ensures your code will pass the GitHub Actions pipeline.

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Run all frontend pipeline checks (recommended before PR)
make check

# Quick check without tests (faster for development)
make check-quick

# Get help with all available commands
make help
```

#### Available Frontend Commands

```bash
# Main pipeline commands
make check          # Run all checks: lint, format, test, build
make check-quick    # Quick version: lint, format, build (no tests)

# Individual checks
make lint           # Run ESLint checks
make format         # Check Prettier formatting
make test           # Run unit and E2E tests (if available)
make build          # Create production build

# Setup and maintenance
make install        # Install dependencies with frozen lockfile
make clean          # Clean node_modules and build artifacts
make setup          # Initial development environment setup
```

#### Pipeline Workflow

The Makefile mirrors the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/frontend-ci-cd.yml`:

1. **Linting & Formatting** - ESLint and Prettier checks
2. **Testing** - Unit tests (Jest) and E2E tests (Cypress) if installed
3. **Build** - Production build verification

### Backend Pipeline Checks

The backend also includes a comprehensive Makefile for CI/CD validation.

#### Backend Quick Start

```bash
cd ../backend

# Run full CI pipeline (matches GitHub Actions)
make ci

# Run all backend workflows (CI + security)
make all

# Get help with all available commands
make help
```

#### Key Backend Commands

```bash
# Main pipeline commands
make ci              # Full CI pipeline: install, format-check, lint, typecheck, test-cov, build
make security-ci     # Security pipeline: install, security-lint, security-test, build
make all             # Run all CI/CD pipelines

# Individual checks
make lint            # Run ESLint
make format-check    # Check Prettier formatting
make typecheck       # TypeScript type checking
make test            # Run unit tests
make test-cov        # Run tests with coverage
make test-e2e        # Run E2E tests (requires PostgreSQL)
make build           # Build the application

# Pre-commit workflow
make pre-commit      # Run format-check, lint, typecheck, test
```

### Before Creating a PR

Run these commands to ensure your PR will pass all pipeline checks:

```bash
# Frontend checks
cd frontend
make check
```

The makefile is designed to replicate the exact same checks that run in GitHub Actions, giving you confidence that your PR will pass the CI/CD pipeline.
