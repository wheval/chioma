# Dispute Resolution Contract

## Overview

The DisputeResolutionContract is a decentralized arbitration system designed to handle stalled escrows and complex agreement disputes through verified arbiters. This contract enables a transparent, vote-based resolution process for disputes between landlords and tenants.

## Motivation

While the escrow contract mentions dispute resolution with arbiter involvement, a dedicated contract provides a more robust framework for:
- Mapping verified arbiters
- Managing dispute tickets
- Enabling vote-based resolution
- Providing transparent and decentralized dispute handling

For example, if a landlord and tenant disagree on a security deposit release, verified arbiters can step in to review off-chain evidence and vote on-chain for the funds' release.

## Features

- **Arbiter Management**: Admin can add verified arbiters to the system
- **Dispute Creation**: Anyone can raise a dispute for a specific agreement
- **Voting System**: Verified arbiters can vote on disputes
- **Majority Rule**: Disputes are resolved based on majority votes
- **Minimum Votes Requirement**: Configurable minimum number of votes required for resolution
- **Transparent Outcome**: Clear outcomes (FavorLandlord or FavorTenant)
- **Dispute Appeals**: Second-level review with separate arbiters and majority decision
- **Timeout Auto-Resolution**: Disputes can be auto-resolved after configurable timeout

pub fn initialize(env: Env, admin: Address, min_votes_required: u32) -> Result<(), DisputeError>
```
Initializes the contract with an admin and minimum votes requirement.

**Parameters:**
- `admin`: Address with administrative privileges
- `min_votes_required`: Minimum votes needed to resolve disputes

**Errors:**
- `AlreadyInitialized`: Contract already initialized

### Add Arbiter (Admin Only)
```rust
pub fn add_arbiter(env: Env, admin: Address, arbiter: Address) -> Result<(), DisputeError>
```
Adds a verified arbiter to handle disputes.

**Parameters:**
- `admin`: Admin address performing the action
- `arbiter`: Address of the arbiter to add

**Errors:**
- `NotInitialized`: Contract not initialized

- `ArbiterAlreadyExists`: Arbiter already registered

### Raise Dispute
```rust
pub fn raise_dispute(env: Env, agreement_id: String, details_hash: String) -> Result<(), DisputeError>

Raises a dispute for a specific agreement.

**Parameters:**
- `agreement_id`: Unique identifier for the agreement
- `details_hash`: Hash reference to off-chain evidence

**Errors:**
- `NotInitialized`: Contract not initialized
- `DisputeAlreadyExists`: Dispute already exists for this agreement
- `InvalidDetailsHash`: Details hash is empty

### Vote on Dispute (Arbiters Only)
```rust
pub fn vote_on_dispute(env: Env, arbiter: Address, agreement_id: String, favor_landlord: bool) -> Result<(), DisputeError>
```
Allows an arbiter to vote on an existing dispute.

**Parameters:**
- `arbiter`: Address of the voting arbiter
- `agreement_id`: ID of the agreement in dispute
- `favor_landlord`: true = favor landlord, false = favor tenant

**Errors:**

- `ArbiterNotFound`: Arbiter doesn't exist or is inactive
- `DisputeNotFound`: Dispute doesn't exist
- `DisputeAlreadyResolved`: Dispute already resolved
- `AlreadyVoted`: Arbiter already voted on this dispute

### Resolve Dispute
```rust
pub fn resolve_dispute(env: Env, agreement_id: String) -> Result<DisputeOutcome, DisputeError>
```
Resolves a dispute by evaluating votes and determining the outcome.

**Parameters:**

### Resolve Dispute On Timeout
```rust
pub fn resolve_dispute_on_timeout(env: Env, agreement_id: String) -> Result<DisputeOutcome, DisputeError>
```
Resolves stale disputes once timeout is reached, even if minimum vote threshold is not met.
Outcome uses current vote totals; ties default to `FavorTenant`.

### Set Timeout Config (Admin Only)
```rust
pub fn set_timeout_config(env: Env, admin: Address, config: TimeoutConfig) -> Result<(), DisputeError>
```

### Get Timeout Config
```rust

```

Rules enforced:
- dispute must be resolved
- appeal must be created within 7 days of dispute resolution
- appeal arbiter panel must exclude original dispute arbiters
- minimum 3 appeal arbiters required
- appeal fee is recorded and tracked

### Vote on Appeal
```rust
pub fn vote_on_appeal(env: Env, arbiter: Address, appeal_id: String, vote: DisputeOutcome) -> Result<(), DisputeError>
```

### Resolve Appeal
```rust
pub fn resolve_appeal(env: Env, appeal_id: String) -> Result<(), DisputeError>
```

Resolution uses majority vote. If appeal outcome differs from original dispute outcome, appeal is approved and fee refund is recorded.

## Usage Example

```rust

contract.initialize(&admin, &3); // Require 3 votes minimum

// Add arbiters
let arbiter1 = Address::generate(&env);
let arbiter2 = Address::generate(&env);
let arbiter3 = Address::generate(&env);
contract.add_arbiter(&admin, &arbiter1);
contract.add_arbiter(&admin, &arbiter2);
contract.add_arbiter(&admin, &arbiter3);

// Raise a dispute
let agreement_id = String::from_str(&env, "agreement_001");
let details_hash = String::from_str(&env, "QmXoypizjW3...");
contract.raise_dispute(&agreement_id, &details_hash);

// Arbiters vote
contract.vote_on_dispute(&arbiter1, &agreement_id, &true);  // Favor landlord
contract.vote_on_dispute(&arbiter2, &agreement_id, &true);  // Favor landlord
contract.vote_on_dispute(&arbiter3, &agreement_id, &false); // Favor tenant

// Resolve dispute
let outcome = contract.resolve_dispute(&agreement_id);
// outcome = DisputeOutcome::FavorLandlord (2-1 vote)
```

## Testing

Run tests with:
```bash
make test
```

Or:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Building

Build the contract with:
```bash
make build
```

Or:
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## Integration

This contract is designed to integrate with:
- **Escrow Contract**: For automatic fund release based on dispute outcomes
- **Property Registry**: To verify agreement legitimacy
- **Off-chain Evidence Storage**: IPFS or similar for dispute details

See [INTEGRATION.md](./INTEGRATION.md) for integration guidelines.

## Security Considerations

1. **Arbiter Trust**: Only trusted arbiters should be added by the admin
2. **Off-chain Evidence**: The contract stores only hashes; actual evidence must be stored off-chain
3. **Finality**: Once resolved, disputes cannot be changed
4. **Minimum Votes**: Configure appropriately based on arbiter pool size
5. **One Vote Per Arbiter**: Each arbiter can only vote once per dispute
