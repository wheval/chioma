## ✅ Best Practices

### Writing Good Issues

**Be Specific**
```
❌ Bad: "Something is broken"
✅ Good: "Login fails with 'Invalid credentials' error when using email with + symbol"
```

**Provide Context**
```
❌ Bad: "It doesn't work"
✅ Good: "On Windows 10, when I click the login button, nothing happens. No error message appears."
```

**Include Reproduction Steps**
```
❌ Bad: "The app crashes sometimes"
✅ Good: "Steps: 1. Open app, 2. Go to properties, 3. Click filter, 4. Select 'price', 5. App crashes"
```

**Add Relevant Details**
- Environment (OS, browser, versions)
- Screenshots or logs
- Related issues or PRs
- Expected vs actual behavior

### Writing Good PRs

**Clear Title**
```
✅ Good: "feat: add dark mode toggle to settings"
✅ Good: "fix: prevent SQL injection in search"
❌ Bad: "update stuff"
```

**Complete Checklist**
- All items should be checked before submitting
- If something doesn't apply, explain why
- Don't skip sections

**Detailed Description**
